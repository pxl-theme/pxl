						<p>Mobile gaming has become a massive industry in recent years, with millions of people downloading and playing games on their smartphones and tablets. As we head into 2022, there are several trends that are poised to shape the future of mobile gaming. One of the biggest is the continued development and implementation of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technology.</p>
						<p>As these technologies become more advanced and accessible, we can expect to see an explosion of new games and experiences that take advantage of the unique capabilities of AR and VR. Another trend to watch is the rise of cloud gaming, which allows players to stream games directly to their devices without needing to download and install them locally. With faster internet speeds and more robust cloud infrastructure, cloud gaming is poised to become a major force in the gaming industry in the coming years.</p>

						</hgroup>
						<!-- <lorem></lorem> -->
						<img class=aligncenter data-src="https://picsum.photos/640/360"/>
						<p>Programming is a constantly evolving field, and developers need to stay up-to-date with the latest techniques and tricks to stay competitive. Here are 10 useful programming tricks that every developer should know. One trick is to use the command line for more efficient coding. This can be especially useful for tasks like navigating directories and running scripts, which can be done much faster using command line tools.</p>
						<p>Another useful trick is to automate repetitive tasks, such as running tests or deploying code. This can be done using tools like Jenkins or Travis CI, which can be configured to automatically run tests and deploy code when new changes are pushed to a repository. By automating these tasks, developers can save time and focus on more important work.</p>

						</hgroup>
						<!-- <lorem></lorem> -->
						<p>No-code development has become a popular way for businesses to build applications and software without needing to hire a dedicated development team. While it's still a relatively new concept, the potential benefits of no-code development are significant. For one, it allows non-technical team members to build and deploy applications, reducing the burden on IT and development teams.</p>
						<p>Additionally, no-code development can lead to faster development cycles and more efficient workflows. However, there are also concerns that no-code development could lead to a decrease in demand for professional developers. As the technology continues to evolve and become more widespread, it will be important for programmers and businesses to adapt and stay competitive in the changing landscape.</p>
